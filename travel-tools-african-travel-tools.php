			  <h3>Best Safari/ Hotels Packages</h3><br>

              We have this system ready made as a plug-in format which could be directly attached with any system matching our codes. The whole reservation system works in sync with the API/XML format without altering its natural course of action. Its most advised for all the Travel/Tour Operators, especially to those who prefer more of CRS system rather than an API/XML based system.
